# DaltoBoulder (Climbing Route Visualizer for Color Blind)
This app helps color-blind (daltonic) boulder climbers identify the holds belonging to their chosen route. The app will highlight the relevant holds to assist climbers to navigate the wall.

# Progerss Summary 
Goal:
1. Highlight climbing holds from a wall image.
2. Identify and highlight a specific route by its color.

Methods Tested:

1. Noise Removal & Smoothing:
  - Used cv.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored and morphological operations to clean up the image and preserve small holds.
   
2. Color-Based Thresholding:
  - Converted images to HSV and tried to segment holds by thresholding hue, saturation, and value.
  - Attempted to classify holds by finding peaks in the hue histogram.
    
3. Manual Color Selection:
  - Selected a pixel as a reference for a routeâ€™s color and segmented similar pixels.

4. Background Removal:
  - Estimated background color using histogram and random sampling, then masked it out.

5. Block-wise Color Segmentation:
  - Divided the image into blocks, found dominant color in each, and masked accordingly.

6. Edge Detection & K-means (Exploratory)
  - Applied edge detection and experimented with blurring and morphological operations.

# Results
- Noise removal and morphological smoothing: improved image quality and hold visibility.
- Color-based segmentation: worked to some extent but struggled with overlapping colors, lighting, and background similarity.
- Manual color selection: could highlight a route but was sensitive to color variation and lighting.
- Block-wise segmentation: helped localize colors but was limited by block size and color diversity.
- Edge detection: provided hold outlines but not reliable segmentation.

# Best Potential
Color-based segmentation (HSV thresholding) combined with morphological operations showed the most promise for highlighting holds and routes, but needs refinement for robustness.

# Ideas Forward
Semantic Segmentation: Use deep learning (e.g., U-Net, Mask R-CNN) to automatically segment holds and routes, regardless of color or lighting.
Data Annotation: Prepare labeled images for training a segmentation model.
Combine Color & Shape: Integrate color segmentation with edge/contour detection for better accuracy.
User Interaction: Allow manual selection of holds/routes to guide segmentation.
